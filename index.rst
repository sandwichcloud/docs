Sandwich Cloud - Bring Cloud-Native to VMware
=============================================

Sandwich Cloud is a cloud platform that is built upon VMware VCenter.

Sandwich Cloud aims to bring most of the power of the cloud (er someone
else's computer) to your VMware VCenter installation. Unlike OpenStack that is
massively complex, Sandwich Cloud tries to be simple and easy with a useable
deployment ready in less than an hour.

Due to this simplicity, Sandwich Cloud does not aim to replicate all functionality
of a true cloud, instead it focuses on just Virtualization.

To get started all you need is an existing VCenter deployment, some esxi hosts
and a routable layer 3 network.
