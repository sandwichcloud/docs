Authentication
==============

Fernet Keys & Tokens
--------------------

Sandwich Cloud uses `Fernet <https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/>`_ tokens
for authorization. These tokens require a key to be encrypted. The key must
be a 32-byte base64 encoded string. Multiple Fernet Keys can be used to allow key
rotation.

These tokens contain information about the user or service account and what roles
they have access to. User tokens expire one day after they are generated while
service account tokens expire 30 minutes after they are requested from the Metadata
service.
